FAQ
---
## How many hours should I spend?
- Besides the 6 hours on site, you should spend as much time as you feel comfortable. We are expecting 15-20 hours. But we are moving at a fast pace, and you are pairing with someone else, so try to keep up! PLEASE talk to us if you are having problems.

## What is required from me every week?
- You are expected to go through the readings and exercises. We will give you exercises that wont be finished by the end of the day and you are expected to go through them at home. We will support you through slack so don't give up! We are also requiring a blog post from you every week. This will solidify what you've learned and keep you on track. 

## What happens if I can’t finish or don’t understand the materials?
- Talk to us! We are here to help you. We cannot help you if you don't tell us you need help! We can provide more personalized help if needed.

## Do I have to go to all the meetings?
- Yes. The concepts that you learn from the previous classes are required for the newer classes. It will be very hard fo you to keep up.

## What do I need on my computer?
- Please follow the Django Girls Installation Chapter and have python, django and atom installed. We are ONLY using atom. Please do not use any other editor during classes while pairing.
